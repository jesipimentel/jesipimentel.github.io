		<h1>Scratch elimination from the surface of polycarbonate visors through air atmospheric pressure plasma jet treatment</h1>

		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>This study utilized air atmospheric pressure plasma to eliminate scratches from the surface of polycarbonate (PC) face shields. PC face shields are personal protective equipment that are generally used for construction and machine shop purposes due to their impact resistance and toughness, though they are soft and prone to scratching. The objective of the study is to improve the optical transmission properties of PC face shields by reducing or eliminating scratches from PC face shields using an atmospheric pressure plasma jet system or APPJ. The optical transmission is characterized using UV-Vis and qualitative analysis on scratch depth and number are characterized using a digital microscope. The APPJ system is composed of two tungsten electrodes encased in a borosilicate glass with a gas inlet connect to an air pump with a maximum output of 25 L/min. The tungsten electrodes are connected to a neon sign transformer capable of outputting 15 kV at 60 Hz. The data shows that the 3-second treatments lead to the most increase in transparency without any changes in focal point due to melting.</p>
