		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>Due to the ongoing transition to clean energy and the fast progress in mobile technology, electrochemical energy storage (EES) has been a study of interest in society today. This research project aims to simulate EES for supercapacitors using graphene-TiO<sub>2</sub> electrodes and a saline electrolyte using LAMMPS, a classical molecular dynamics simulator. The electrode was generated, minimized, and introduced to a potential drop using LAMMPS. They follow planar and the nano-slit pore models with different pore widths and a constant potential introduced to it. The charge was taken by fitting a best-fit exponential curve into the plot of the charge of form <i>q</i>(<i>t</i>) = <i>q</i><sub>max</sub>(1 â€“ e<sup><i>t/t'</i></sup>) where <i>t'</i> is the time at equilibration of the system and <i>q</i><sub>max</sub> is the average charge after equilibration. The differential capacitance was found by finding the value of <i>q</i>(<i>t</i>) at <i>t</i> = 100000 fs and the potential drop <i>V</i>, using the slope of the best fit line of the plot of <i>Q</i>/<i>V</i>. The calculated quantities and expressions include those of charge and differential capacitance. The results have shown that the nano-slit pore model with <i>&delta;</i> = 3.10 &Aring; exhibited the highest specific capacitance while the nano-slit pore model with <i>&delta;</i> = 7.10 &Aring; exhibited the lowest specific capacitance.</p>
