		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a fresh graduate of Ateneo de Manila University under the BS Applied Physics - BS Materials Science and Engineering program. My research foci were in plasma treatment and molecular dynamics for my first and second theses projects, respectively. I have current interests in renewable energy research and the like. I have presented in two international symposia and currently working on getting my research work published.</p>

		<h2>Research Work</h2>
		<h3>Seminars and Symposia Attended</h3>
		<p>My research work during my undergraduate years revolved around the treatment of surfaces using atmospheric pressure plasma as well as for Molecular Dynamics. I am one of the authors of a manual on the usage of the Large Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) presented and used during the Vacuum Society of the Philippines' second webinar <b><i>Plasma and Society II</i></b> by Ms. Catherine Joy Dela Cruz. I have also presented two different studies in two international symposia. The first of these was an oral presentation in Baguio City, Philippines during the <b><i>5th International Symposium of the Vacuum Society of the Philippines</i></b> where I presented my study on Molecular Dynamics. The second of these presentations was a poster presentation in Nagoya, Japan where I presented my work on Plasma Treatment of Materials at <b><i>ISPlasma 2024</i></b>. The links to these events are shown below.</p>
